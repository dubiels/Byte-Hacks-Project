# Byte-Hacks-Project
This is the mobile application for the Byte Hacks 2020 submission. The mobile code and UI was made by Karolina Dubiel. 

ImmiRent is a mobile application designed to help 18th and 19th century Ellis Island immigrants find housing. 

The files are XCode files, and operate under Swift 5. 
They use a MapKit framework. 

The application is a table-view based application with a navigation-view controller, and a good "skeleton project" for tab-based apps.
